Building Fusion

Fusion uses Apache Ant for building and deploying the source code to a web 
server for developers working from the SVN repository.  End users deploying a 
packaged distribution zip file need not worry about building fusion.  
A target is included for building a single file, compressed version of the 
JavaScript and CSS files for optimizing performance of your fusion application.

Ant is a Java application and therefore Java must be installed on the developers
machine.  Download and install the latest release of Ant (http://ant.apache.org/).
To use Ant, navigate to the directory containing the build.xml file (usually
the root directory of the project) and execute one of the ant targets, e.g.:

> ant compress

For some tasks, external executable files are used and must be available for 
execution on the PATH environment variable.

Targets available include:

prepare - creates a "build" subdirectory with all files required to be put on 
          the web server
deploy  - places a copy of the build directory in the web server HTDOCS directory
clean   - removes the temporary build directory
clean-all - executes the clean target and also removes the deployed application
            from the web server
dist      - creates a packaged ZIP file for distribution
docs      - automatically generates class documentation from the source code
concat    - concatenates all core Fusion files into a singleFile
singleFile - creates a single file version of the fusion library.  
            If the appDef property points to an ApplicationDefinition.xml file,
            it will be converted to JSON and included in the resulting package.
compress  - creates a compressed single file version of the fusion library.  
            If the appDef property points to an ApplicationDefinition.xml file,
            it will be converted to JSON and included in the resulting package.
compressCSS  - creates a compressed single file version of CSS files listed in
            the cssFiles property.
            
concatWithAppDef and concatNoAppDef are internal targets not intended for end users.


Properties that can be set (and their defaults) include:
  <property name="YUIcompressor"  value="${basedir}/utils/yuicompressor-2.3.6.jar"/>
  <property name="sfName"  value="fusionSF"/>
  <property name="buildOutput"  value="${build.home}/lib/${sfName}"/>
  <property name="cssOutput"  value="${build.home}/lib/${sfName}"/>
  <property name="cssFiles"  value=""/>
  <property name="PHP" value="/usr/local/php5cgi/bin/php"/>


These properties can be assigned a value when ant is invoked by using the
-D command line option, e.g.:

C:\pathTo\fusion>ant compressCSS -DcssFiles="jx\lib\jx_combined.css,jx\css\jxskin-border.css"
C:\pathTo\fusion>ant compress -DappDef=templates\mapguide\standard\ApplicationDefinition.xml

File paths are relative to the current directory (where the build.xml file is).

Don't include file suffixes with the sfName and cssOutput properties, 
the suffix will be added automatically.
