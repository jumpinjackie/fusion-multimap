Fusion Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

About Fusion
------------

Fusion is a toolkit for building web-mapping applications on top of
MapGuide Open Source/Enterprise (MGOS/E) and MapServer.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You must first obtain and correctly install MapServer or MGOS/E and one of the
Web Server Extension API languages.  Currently, Fusion only supports
PHP.

Once you have a working MapGuide OS/E or MapServer installation with PHP API
extensions, you can install Fusion.

Obtaining Fusion
----------------

The primary doucmentation for Fusion is available at http://trac.osgeo.org/fusion/
and you can download Fusion from http://download.osgeo.org/fusion/

Installing Fusion
-----------------

NOTE: It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you install Fusion inside the
WebServerExtensions/www directory of your MGOS/E installation or in a web 
accessible directory for MapServer (/apps using MS4W).

Fusion must be installed on the same server as your MGOS/E Web Server
Extensions because it uses the API included with the Web Server
Extensions.

To install Fusion, simply extract your Fusion source code package 
(either tar.gz or zip file).  Then copy the file fusion/config_dist.json to
fusion/config.json and edit this new file for your system configuration.

By default, Fusion is configured to be installed into the 'www' directory of 
your WebServerExtensions installation.
You may install Fusion into a different location, as long as you follow
the Configuring Fusion steps below.

Configuring Fusion for MapGuide
-------------------------------

If you installed Fusion into the WebServerExtensions/www directory, and your
WebServerExtensions are installed in C:\Program Files, Fusion is ready to
go.

If the Web Server Extensions are installed elsewhere, you must now 
change the default values in the following file:

fusion/mapguide/php/Common.php

At the beginning of this file are two lines as follows:

$defaultInstallDir = dirname(__FILE__)."/../../../../../";
$defaultExtensionDir = realpath($defaultInstallDir . "webserverextensions/www/");

Modify these lines to point to your actual installation path.

If Fusion is not installed inside the WebServerExtensions/www directory,
you must configure your web server to provide web access to Fusion.

Doing this is dependent on the actual web server you have installed.  You 
need to set up alias (Apache) or virtual directory (IIS) to the 'fusion'
directory and configure it to allow execution of PHP scripts.

If you do not know how to configure your web server to do this, please
move the 'fusion' directory to the WebServerExtensions/www directory.

Testing your Installation
-------------------------

Fusion comes with some sample applications in the samples directory.  To
test your Fusion installation, you need to modify these applications for
your particular setup and then load the applications.  If you get a map,
everything is good!

To configure the sample applications, you need to edit the following files:

* index.html

  look for the <script> tag that includes fusion.js and modify the url
  appropriately.  It is configured to use localhost:8008, which will 
  work for local installations of MGOS/E
  
* ApplicationDefinition.xml

  the sample applications are configured to load the Sheboygan sample
  map that is freely available with MGOS/E and the GMAP dataset for MapServer.  
  If you do not have the sample data set installed, have installed it in a 
  different location than the default, or simply wish to use a different map, 
  you will need to edit this file.  Look for the following block:
  
    <MapGroup id="sheboygan" xsi:type="MapType">
      <Map xsi:type="MapGuideLayerType">
        <Type>MapGuide</Type>
        <SingleTile>true</SingleTile>
        <Extension>
          <ResourceId>Library://Samples/Sheboygan/Maps/Sheboygan.MapDefinition</ResourceId>
        </Extension>
      </Map>
    </MapGroup>
  
  Change the ResourceId tag to point to the appropriate MapDefinition.
  
  or for MapServer:
  
      <MapGroup id="gmap" xsi:type="MapType">
      <Map xsi:type="MapLayerType">
        <Type>MapServer</Type>
        <SingleTile>true</SingleTile>
        <Extension>
            <MapFile>/ms4w/apps/gmap/htdocs/gmap75.map</MapFile>
        </Extension>
      </Map>
    </MapGroup>
  Change the MapFile tag to point to the appropriate Map file.
